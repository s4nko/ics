	         <p>Tournaments in eSports are like regular sports tournaments. Each player shows his skill and gives the team hope for victory. And these are mostly tournaments that pay well depending on the level of the league. The higher the league level and team skill, the greater the reward. There is no best tournament in esports, there are only popular and less popular ones. Difference in league levels and rewards.

		            <p>The Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) was a professional sports tournament organization specializing in computer and console video game competitions. It was founded by Angel Munoz on June 27, 1997, in Dallas, Texas. The CPL is considered the pioneer in professional video game tournaments, which have been held worldwide. The CPL's tournaments are open to all registrants, but due to the ESRB content rating of some video games, CPL competitions are restricted to participants age 17 or older. The CPL has distributed more than US$3 million in cash prizes.

	         <p>We are ICS. We made this site to make it convenient for people to view information about players and matches. Monitor their game statistics and analyze matches. There are many sites such as HLTV and others. But we are no exception, because we are an excellent source of information and an excellent esports industry navigator. The main category of this site is informational activity that helps a person to learn more about eSports, eSports teams, players and their popularity. When the match ends or the final results are announced, we adjust, update and change the player's statistics. Each player has such factor as K/D. It denotes the total number of kills and deaths. Many players believe that K / D decides and who has more - that professional. But this is completely wrong, because it all depends on his level of skill in the game, knowledge of maps, his strategy and the level of communication with his teammates.</p>

                  <p>CIS Counter-Strike is heavily overrated, it's not a normal Counter-Strike. The way they play, the way they generally approach CS… It will never work in the long run. The only team that has been successful with this approach is Natus Vincere. Everyone else was leveling off. I really hate Counter-Strike CIS.
